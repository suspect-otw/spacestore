## Notes
- Clerk provides a more streamlined authentication experience compared to building custom auth
- The admin dashboard should be completely separate from the user-facing application
- Consider implementing progressive permissions where users can be granted specific admin capabilities
- All user data operations must comply with relevant data protection regulations
- Performance monitoring should be implemented from the beginning to identify bottlenecks
- Consider implementing a feedback mechanism for users during the initial rollout
