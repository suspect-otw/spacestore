# Database Implementation Checklist

## 1. [x] Creating Database Connections And Implementations

### First Phase
- [x] Set up Prisma client with proper connection pooling
- [x] Create data service functions with caching
- [x] Fix type issues with Prisma client
- [x] Fix database connection string URL encoding issues
- [x] Switch from Prisma to direct Supabase client for better compatibility

### Second Phase
- [x] Update brands page to use real data
- [x] Update brand detail page to use real data
- [x] Update product detail page to use real data
- [x] Fix async mapping in components
- [x] Update UI components to match Supabase data structure

### Third Phase
- [x] Add loading state component
- [x] Add error handling for server components
- [x] Add pagination for large data sets
- [x] Implement more efficient search functionality with pagination
- [x] Fix client/server component issues

## 2. [ ] Test the last changes
- [ ] Test brands listing with real data
- [ ] Test brand detail page with real data
- [ ] Test product detail page with real data
- [ ] Test search functionality with real data
- [ ] Test pagination functionality
- [ ] Test error handling
- [ ] Test performance with large data sets

## 3. [ ] Authentication and User Management
- [ ] Implement Clerk authentication (see PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md)
- [ ] Update database schema to support user authentication
- [ ] Create user profiles and preferences
- [ ] Implement role-based access control
- [ ] Add secure API routes with authentication

## 4. [ ] Dashboard Implementation
- [ ] Create user dashboard (see PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS_DOCUMENT.md)
- [ ] Implement admin dashboard
- [ ] Add analytics and reporting features
- [ ] Create request management system
- [ ] Implement notification system

## Next Steps
1. After testing, consider implementing a more robust caching strategy using SWR or React Query
2. Add more sophisticated error handling for specific database errors
3. Consider adding a connection status indicator
4. Monitor database performance in production
5. Implement more advanced filtering options
6. Integrate authentication with existing data services
7. Implement user-specific data views and permissions

## Notes
- The current implementation uses React's built-in cache function for basic caching
- We're extracting brand names from URLs which might need refinement
- We're using placeholder images for all brands and products
- Error handling is now done with try/catch in server components
- Pagination and ErrorBoundary components are now client components with 'use client' directive
- We've switched from Prisma ORM to direct Supabase client for better compatibility with Next.js App Router
- Authentication will be handled by Clerk for a more streamlined experience
- User and admin dashboards will be implemented as separate sections of the application
